# Streamlit Extras Demo  

This is a quick test of all the Streamlit extras from [this repository](https://arnaudmiribel.github.io/streamlit-extras/).  

Some of these extras may be moved to the official Streamlit package or deprecated in the future.  

If you find any non-working examples, please feel free to fix and upload it :-)
